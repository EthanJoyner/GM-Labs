    "# Absorption of Beta Particles\n",
    "## **Introduction:**\n",
    "Beta particles are electrons that are emitted from an atom when it decays by converting a neutron (n) to a proton (p), an electron (e<sup>-</sup>), and and an anti-neutrino ($\\bar{ν}$). When an electron originates in the nucleus, it is called a beta particle. Beta particles are emitted with a range of energies between 0 MeV and the maximum energy for a given radioactive isotope. The spectrum is not linear and “tails” off at high energy, which means that there are very few beta particles. Therefore, beta particles do not all have the same range. When the range varies over different values, this is called range straggling. It represents the different energy losses all of the beta particles have given their different initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you will find the range of beta particles by measuring their attenuation with absorbers and extrapolating the absorption curve. The range R will then be substituted into the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{\\beta} = 1.84R + 0.212 \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where R is in g/cm<sup>2</sup>. (Note that the units for R are not the same as the absorber thicknesses. You must convert at the end.)\n"
