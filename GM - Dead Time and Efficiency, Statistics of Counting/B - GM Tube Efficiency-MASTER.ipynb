Most of the sources used in nuclear experiments have activities on the order of microcuries (µCi).\n","\n","The amount of radiation the source emits is proportional to its activity, A (in Ci), and the intensity, I_g, for that particular radiation. The I_g is the fraction of decays in which the atom emits that particular radiation.\n","\n","$$\n","Rate = A * I_g * 3.7*10^{10}\n","$$\n","\n","From earlier experiments, you should have learned that a GM tube does not count all the particles that are emitted from a source, i.e., dead time. In addition, some of the particles do not strike the tube at all, because they are emitted uniformly in all directions from the source. Unless the detector completely surrounds the source, only a certain percentage of it will strike the detector. This is known as the geometric efficiency, ε_g. ε_g depends on the fraction of the solid angle surrounding the source that the detector subtends.\n","\n","Not all radiation that strikes the detector will be counted. Some will pass straight through without interacting, and some will interact but fail to deposit all of their energy resulting in no count. The fraction of raduation that strikes the detector and results in a count is known as the detector's intrinsic efficiency, ε_I. ε_I is a function of the detector as well as the type of radiation.\n","\n","The total efficiency of the detector, ε_T is the fraction of radiation emitted by the source that are counted by the detector.\n","\n","\n","$$\n","ε_T=ε_I*ε_g=\\frac{Counts}{A*I_g}\n","$$\n","\n","Once the total detector efficiency is known, it can be seen that by rearrangement of equation (2), the number of counts can be used to determine the total source activity.
