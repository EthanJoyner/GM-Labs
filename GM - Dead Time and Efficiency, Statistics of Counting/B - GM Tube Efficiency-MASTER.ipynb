In addition, some of the particles do not strike the tube at all, because they are emitted uniformly in all directions from the source. Unless the detector completely surrounds the source, only a certain percentage of it will strike the detector. This is known as the geometric efficiency, ε_g. ε_g depends on the fraction of the solid angle surrounding the source that the detector subtends.\n",
